# Hi, I'm Soham 👋

I'm a Computer Science Engineering student at **Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering (2024–2028)**, based in Mumbai.

I like working on backend-heavy projects, real-time systems, and full-stack apps where I can own things end to end.  
Most of what I learn comes from building projects and breaking them until they work.
