## 🚀 About Me

I'm a motivated computer science undergraduate who enjoys building **end-to-end products**, not just demos.  
I like working close to the backend — designing APIs, handling real-time communication, and integrating AI where it makes sense.

I’ve worked on projects involving:
- REST APIs & authentication
- Real-time WebSocket systems
- OCR + AI pipelines
- Clean, modular backend architectures

I also actively solve **DSA problems** and focus on writing readable, maintainable code.
